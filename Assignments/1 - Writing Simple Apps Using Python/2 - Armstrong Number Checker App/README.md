# Armstrong Number Checker App
This app uses a simple user-friendly GUI to take input from the user and checks whether the given number is an Armstrong number or not and shows the result on the GUI (number is an Armstrong if sum of n-th power of each digit in the number is equal to number itself, where n is length of the number)

## Requirements
This project requires [Python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) and the following Python library installed:
- [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt)

Here is how to install the required library with the terminal or command window :<br />
```bash
