## Requirements
This project requires [Python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) and the following Python library installed:
- [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt)

Here is how to install the required library with the terminal or command window :<br />
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```
If you do not have pip installed, you can run the code below in the terminal or command window
- For Linux / MacOS
```bash
python get-pip.py
```
- For Windows

```
These were the requirements for `Roman_to_Decimal.py`. The `Roman to decimal.ipynb` requires [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html) to be installed on your computer.

## How to Run
Open the terminal or command window and run the code below:
* To run `Roman_to_Decimal.py`,
```bash
python Roman_to_Decimal.py
```
* To run `Roman to decimal.ipynb`
```bash
jupyter notebook 'Roman to decimal.ipynb'
```

## App Usage Example

* To handle wrong inputs from user, there is error message for non-roman characters<br />
<br />![invalid_input](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53794602/134482198-506e1b0b-fa25-4dd0-987e-a0315b718747.png)<br />


* Since roman numbers are all in capital form, small letter inputs are directly converted to capital leters<br />

* Lastly, program doesn't allow to give 4 sequential characters since it is not accepted in roman numbers<br />
